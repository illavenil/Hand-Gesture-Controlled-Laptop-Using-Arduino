# Hand gesture controlled laptop using arduino

In this project, we have implemented a simple Arduino based hand gesture control where you can control few functions of your web browser like switching between tabs,
scrolling up and down in web pages, shift between tasks (applications), play or pause a video and increase or decrease the volume (in VLC Player) with the help of 
hand gestures.
Circuit Diagram:

Gesture 1: Place your hand in front of the Right Ultrasonic Sensor at a distance (between 15CM to 35CM) for a small duration and move your hand away from the sensor.
This gesture will Scroll Down the Web Page or Decrease the Volume.

Gesture 2: Place your hand in front of the Right Ultrasonic Sensor at a distance (between 15CM to 35CM) for a small duration and move your hand towards the sensor. 
This gesture will Scroll up the Web Page or Increase the Volume.

Gesture 3: Swipe your hand in front of the Right Ultrasonic Sensor. This gesture will move to the Next Tab.

Gesture 4: Swipe your hand in front of the Left Ultrasonic Sensor. This gesture will move to the Previous Tab or Play/Pause the Video.

Gesture 5: Swipe your hand across both the sensors (Left Sensor first). This action will Switch between Tasks.
